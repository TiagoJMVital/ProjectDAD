# DAD Project

This repository is a copy of DAD (Distributed Application Development) project.


## System prupose

For this project, we were asked to develop a Single-Page Application (SPA) for a Memory Game Platform. The goal is to allow users to play a digital version of the classic Memory Game with differente board sizes.

To achieve this, we are implementing:

A frontend (everything except the project_api and websockets folder) using Vue.js, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface. A backend with a RESTful API using Laravel in linux (folder project_api) and a WebSocket server (folder websockets), responsible for game logic, user management, and a chat for the players to interact. A database to store user accounts, game history, and transactions, supporting a virtual credit system called "Brain Coins." Registered users can track their performance through leaderboards, and purchase additional Brain Coins for extended gameplay. The platform also includes administrative controls for managing users, transactions, and platform statistics.

## Components

- SPA using Vue.js;
- Backend with a RESTful API using Laravel in linux;
- WebSocket server

## Group Size
